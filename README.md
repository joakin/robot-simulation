## Problem statement

Create a Javascript application in which you can simulate controlling a robot.
The robot should be placed on a 5x5 grid. Supply controls that let you move the
robot forwards in the direction it is facing, and rotate the robot in place to
face any cardinal direction. Use any Javascript framework youâ€™re comfortable
with, as long as it runs in modern web browsers.

Commit your code in a git repository and submit a tarball of that repository
when you submit your application.
